# Under Pressure Project

<img src = "/space/space9.png" width = "400">

This is the most recent release of my game Under Pressure. This game was a project for my intro to game programming course.
This is a text base game with mouse click. It has multple choice answers and only 2 outcomes. I used the pygame Library
and gimp for simple graphics and transitions. This was my first coding project. I decided to go in and use what I learned
to clean up alot of the code. This is still a work in prograss as I continue to clean up code and fixes. Thank you!

# Things I learned

* Adding Graphics, sound, and characters using pygame
* Using loops and conditions to perform tasks
* importing needed api libraries
* Setting location and font for text/graphics 
* Importing text from seperate text documents and displaying it to the user
* Created a complete game from start to finish
