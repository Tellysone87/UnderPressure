# Under Pressure Project

<img src = "/space/space9.png" width = "400">

This is the most recent release of my game Under Pressure. This game was a project for my intro to game programming course.
This is a text base game with mouse click. It has multiple choice answers and only 2 outcomes. I used the pygame Library
and gimp for simple graphics and transitions. This was my first coding project. I decided to go in and use what I learned
to clean up a lot of the code. This is still a work in progress as I continue to clean up code and fixes. Thank you!
